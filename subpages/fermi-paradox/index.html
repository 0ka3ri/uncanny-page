      <h1>Fermi Paradox</h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>
        "Where is everybody?"., it's supposedly what Enrico Fermi said en 1950 while having a discussion with
        his coworkers about the conflict between the argument of there being a high probability of advanced
        intelligent extraterrestrial life being out there and the lack of concrete evidence that proofs it's
        existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fermi was an Italian and naturalized citizen of the U.S. physicist who is known for being the creator
        of the first nuclear reactor and for being a part of the Manhattan Project, which was a program led by
        the U.S., United Kingdom and Canada committed to develop nuclear weapons during World War II. Later on,
        the
        <a class="italic" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox" target="blank"><i>Fermi Paradox</i></a>
        was analyzed and published by the astrophysicist Michael H. Hart (sidenote: he was an active white
        supremacist). But apparently, the first to formulate this conflict was actually Konstantin Tsiolkovsky,
        a Russian rocket scientist.
      </p>

      <h2>Drake's equation</h2>
      <p>
        Many physicist and astrophysicist have adreseed this issue since its explicitation. In 1961, Frank
        Drake formulated the
        <a class="italic" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation" target="blank"><i>Drake equation</i></a>
        in order to estimate the probable number of intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way.
        The equation goes:
      </p>
      <p>
        N = R∗ × fp × ne × fl × fi × fc × L
      </p>
      <p>
        Where:
        <ul>
          <li>N is the number of currently active, communicative civilizations in our galaxy.</li>
          <li>R∗ is the rate at which stars form in our galaxy.</li>
          <li>fp is the fraction of stars with planets.</li>
          <li>ne is the number of planets that can potentially host life, per star that has planets.</li>
          <li>fl is the fraction of the above that actually do develop life of any kind.</li>
          <li>fi is the fraction of the above that develop intelligent life.</li>
          <li>fc is the fraction of the above that develop the capacity for interstellar communication.</li>
          <li>L is the length of time that such communicative civilizations are active.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The equation was criticized because it takes a lot of assumptions in order for it to work and so it has
        been adapted and changed by many scientist throughout the years, including Carl Sagan who made his own
        version of it. The original results that Drake got showed a minimum of 20 posible civilizations and a
        maximum of 50000000. Quite a range there...
