      <h1>Impostor Syndrome</h1>
      <p>
        This self projection that one is not good enough is a psychollogical mental space in which a person
        feels their knowledge, skill or experience on a specific field or subject is not real and doesn't
        deserve any kind of recognition. It usually drives to feel like a hoax or like one's skill is being
        faked, no matter the level of formality of the setting in which the
        <a class="italic" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome" target="blank">
        <i>Impostor Syndrome</i></a> is activated -it can happen in academic, work, or general social spaces
        equally-.
      </p>
      <p>
        The concept was introduced in 1978 by the two PhDs psychologists from U.S.,
        <a class="italic" href="https://www.paulineroseclance.com/" target="blank"><i>Pauline Rose Clance</i></a>
        and <a class="italic" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/suzanne-imes-6a100044" target="blank">
        <i>Suzanne Imes</i></a>, who found out it was becoming an increasingley common phenomenon. Even though
        the diagnosis hasn't been labeled as an official psychollogical disorder, its effects makes a lot of
        people struggle and suffer from it, and it cointinous to be a frequent topic in therapy sessions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In their <a class="italic" href="https://www.paulineroseclance.com/pdf/ip_high_achieving_women.pdf" target="blank">
        <i>original research</i></a>, Clance and Imes pointed out that Impostor Syndrome was a much more common
        phenomenon in women than among men, who, if they had it, had a less frequent and intense experience.
        They also concluded that the cause of this self underminement in women is an internalization of the
        stereotype that establishes that women are not and cannot be competent in certain fields. Hence, as a
        woman who succeded in her field or job you would be inclined to believe your sucess is a matter of luck,
        good timming or due to an external missreading of your actual abilities, and all this in spite of there
        being evidence that proofs otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another thing they pointed out, is that the feeling of being a fraud doesn't wear off by making more
        achievments. Instead, doing so reinforces the pressure of having to keep up with the performance so
        other people don't find out the truth about yourself.
      </p>

      <h2>Therapy approach</h2>
      <p>
        The original discoverers of this phenomenon applied cognitive aproaches with their patients. Some of
        them were cultivating self compassion, voluntarily stopping defeatist intrusive thoughts, keeping
        record of external positive feedback and one's reactions to it, and other Gestalt techniques that
        involved group exchange with other people wtih the same issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later on, many psychologists continued to investigate the Impostor Syndrome and developed different
        techniches to overcome it. PhD psychologist Joan Carol Harvey created an actual scale to measure a self
        reported intensity of the Impostor Syndrome in order to have a more precise way of identifying it.
