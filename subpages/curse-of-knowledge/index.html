      <h1>Curse of Knowledge</h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>The <a class="italic" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge" target="blank"><i>Curse
        of Knowledge</i></a> is a cognitive bias that makes an individual unconsciously assume that other people have
        the same information and background of a specific subject as them. So, the more a person knows and
        becomes an expert on a subject, more they forget what it's like not knowing about that subjet, which
        can lead to having a lot ot trouble communicating with people that are not familiared with the topic.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, I as a trans person have read a lot of books on queer theory and tend to have many
        discussions with other queer people about gender identity, queerness, etc,. However, when I've had to
        discuss this issue with people that don't know what gender identity is and have only seen trans people
        poorly represented in mainstream movies of the 90's, I find it hard to define what identity even is in
        the first place -not that anyone should define it anyway- because I've internalized my trans identity
        to the point that I can't separate it from my daily life in order to share what it means to me.
      </p>

      <h2>A bit of history...</h2>
      <p>
        The antecedent of the Curse of Knowledge is another bias called
        <a class="italic" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias" target="_blank"><i>Hindsight bias</i></a>
        , which was first published in 1975 by the U.S. phsychologist Baruch Fischhoff. In his article
        “Hindsight ≠ foresight: The effect of outcome knowledge on judgement under uncertainty.”, he
        establishes that people tend to find an event's outcome more predictable after they know what that
        outcome was.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apparently, to test this hyptothesis Fischhoff got together with the israeli psychologyst Ruth
        Beyth-Marom and made an experiment in which they asked the participants to predict how likely the
        various outcomes to the then U.S. President Nixon's upcoming trip to China and the Soviet Union were.
        When Nixon returned, they asked the participants to recall their predictions. The results
        showed that they did not stick to their original predictions and instead recalled them as alined to the
        actual outcome they now knew to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on the Hindsight bias, the term Curse of Knowledge was then used in 1989 in the arcticle
        <a class="italic" href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/docs/loewenstein/CurseknowledgeEconSet.pdf" target="_blank">
        <i>"The curse of knowledge in economic settings: An experimental analysis”</i></a>written by economists
        Colin Camerer, George Loewenstein, and Martin Weber who actually credited the psychologist Robin Miles
        Hogarth for coining the term. Camerer, Leowstein and Weber applied the bias in economic transaction
        contexts.
