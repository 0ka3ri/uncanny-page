        <h2>A personal list of curious psychological phenomena, paradoxes and cognitive biases</h2>
      </div>

      <section class="introduction">
        <p>So, this is just a small personal project that came to being because of an interest on random
          things and because I wanted to put to practice my recently acquired basic knowledge on HTML, CSS
          and JavaScript. That said, I know there's hundreds of paradoxes and phenomenons like the ones
          included on this page, but if I wanted to include them all it would just be a thorough exhaustive
          list without cause or meaning. Instead, I detailed only the ones that I personally had fun finding
          out with, that have a specific usefulness for me or that woke my curiosity for whatever reason.
          Some of them actually let me view personal situations with a new lens or perspective.*
        </p>
        <p>
          However, I would also like for this list to be collaborative and I'm always interesting in curious
          facts in general, so if you can think of a phenomenon that really interests you or that you somehow
          applied to your day-to-day life please let me know about it!.
        </p>

        <p class="italic disclaimer">
          *Disclaimer: the inclusion of these biases does not mean that I approve the experiments that might
          have been conducted in order to discover them nor the original use that they were given, which in
          some cases might have been related to specific economical or political interests.

          *Disclaimer 2: his page is not intended to be taken seriously and its content is the result of
          a curious person, not from a serious researcher. If you're interested in cognitive biases you
          should totally search for real essays!
