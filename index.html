        <h2>A personal list of curious psychological phenomena, paradoxes and cognitive biases</h2>
      </div>

      <section class="introduction">
        <p>So, this is just a small personal project that came to being because of an interest 
          on random things and because I wanted to put to practice my recently acquired basic 
          knowledge on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
          That said, I know there's hundreds of paradoxes and phenomenons like the ones included 
          on this page, but if I wanted to include them all it would just be a thorough exhaustive 
          list without cause or meaning. Instead, I detailed only the ones that I personally had 
          fun finding out with, that have a specific usefulness for me or that woke my curiosity 
          for whatever reason. Some of them actually let me view personal situations with a new 
          lens or perspective. 
          <br>
          <br>
          However, I would also like for this list to be collaborative and 
          I'm always interesting in curious facts in general, so if you can think of a phenomenon 
          that really interests you or that you somehow applied to your day-to-day life please let me 
          know about it!.
