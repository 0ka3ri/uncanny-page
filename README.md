This is my first personal project on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It's a minimalist page with information about cognitive biases and psychological paradoxes.

The page is mantained by me and the building process as well as the deployment has been mentored by @mauriciopasquier (https://github.com/mauriciopasquier).
