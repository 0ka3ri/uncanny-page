      <h1>Observer-expectancy Effect</h1>
      <p>Closely related to the <a class="italic" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias" blank="target">
        <i>Confirmation Bias</i></a>, the <a class="italic" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer-expectancy_effect" blank="target">
        <i>Observer-expectancy Effect</i></a> is a phenomenon that occurs in science scenarios, in which a
        person who's conducting an experiment ends up unnintendently making an impact on the results they
        get by having some kind of influence on the participants of the experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
        An off-the-lab example could be of a person making an interview to someone and affecting their
        response by unconsciously reacting to their answers or making faces in a way that makes them feel
        judged or inhibits them, therefore making them omit things that they would have said originally.
        Being completely serious and as neutral as possible, would also influence the interviewee in some
        way as they could feel awkward with the coldness of the mood or not comfortable enough to share
        things in a loose way.
      </p>
      <p>So, the premise behind the Observer-expectancy Effect is that it's almost impossible to not have
        some kind of impact on the conclusions we draw from learning something, mostly if it implies
        interaction with other people or non-human animals. This is because our own presence has an impact
        on the people/animals/stuff we're learning from and we end up changing the objet of knowledge
        itself. However, even if the Observer-expectancy effect can't be completely deactivated, it can be
        minimized by simply being aware of its existence and taking into consideration how your attitude
        might be affecting someone without you knowing so. Comunication, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        I found this to be particularly interesting if you apply it to daliy conversations or conflict
        solving that involves other people, even if you're not actually making an experiment on them /joke.
      </p>
